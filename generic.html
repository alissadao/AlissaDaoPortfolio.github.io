								<p>Hi everyone. My name is Alissa Dao - a sophomore at Dickinson College majoring in data analytics. I'm a reflective writer, a voracious reader, and a driven data analyst. Data collection, analysis, visualization, and storytelling are my passions. In addition, I enjoy exploring and communicating the critical insights hidden in the data.</p>
								<p>Skillsets:<br />
								- Python, R, SQL Server, Tableau <br />
							    - PowerBi, Excel, PowerPoint, Google docs</p>
								<p>Recently, I have had an opportunity to work as a data storyteller intern at Balance Now for three months. I researched, compiled, and interpreted more than 100 databases during my internship. After that, I used the data I just analyzed to pitch and publish 15 articles about diversity and inclusion. Moreover, I also utilized Excel to organize, clean, and visualize data about distinctiveness in films. My daily work was also drafting questions and interviewing around 20 people from different industries to get a deeper insight into a problem. </p>
								<p>By the end of my internship, I had contributed 10% more reactions to the company's Instagram posts than before.</p>

								<p>Since I was a kid, I have established a writer and book lover mindset for myself. I am constantly immersed in coloring the 'personalities' of each sentence level, maybe the paragraph, the words, and the punctuation. Sometimes, I find myself soaking in discovering the meaning behind each sentence in the book I am reading.</p>
								<p>As I grew up with a positive attitude toward finding, interpreting, and expressing the purpose of words, I fell in love with discovering, analyzing, and presenting the meaning behind each number. That is why I decided to become a Data Analyst. With the help of some tools such as SQL, Python, R, Tableau, and PowerBi, I can bring light to the hidden implication of raw numbers.</p>
								<p>When I was first working with statistics, I was terrified. My fear, however, vanished when I understood that I could hunt for the meaning of these numbers. Let me guide you to the land of expressive numbers if you're also feeling lost in lifeless and ambiguous numbers.</p>
								<p>Thank you so much for spending time viewing my portfolio. Feel free to connect and reach me! My email: thieennann1405@gmail.com </p>
